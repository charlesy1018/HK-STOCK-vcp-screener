# HK-STOCK-vcp screener
Stock-vcpscreener is a simple stock screener that calculates various market breadth indicators and selects HK stocks on a daily basis based on multiple criteria. The criteria are applied to the simple moving averages and price performance of the stocks over the last year. The goal is to look for a volatility contraction pattern in the market, a specific chart pattern that suggests the stock may move into an uptrend in the near future.

This project started off as a code refactoring practice based on a command-line stock screener I saw on an online forum (ref: carlam.net), which in turn seems to be inspired from this medium article after a bit of googling. User from now could retrevied email notice of daily HK Stock Market Breadth as well as stock recommendation. For full review, please open Final Product Folder.
